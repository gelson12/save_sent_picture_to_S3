# Overview:
This Terraform configuration simulates an AWS infrastructure required to:

Trigger a Lambda function via an API Gateway.

Save received data to an S3 bucket.

Deploy Lambda within a private VPC.

Components:
AWS API Gateway: Simulated endpoint triggers the Lambda.

AWS Lambda Function: Dummy function deployed within private VPC.

AWS S3 Bucket: Dummy storage for data.

Private VPC: Provides secure isolation for Lambda.

Usage Instructions:
Prerequisites: Install Terraform and LocalStack (for local AWS simulation).

Deployment:

terraform init
terraform apply

Verification:
The dummy API Gateway endpoint provided in Terraform outputs simulates the API interaction. Check Terraform outputs after deployment for details.

Security Considerations:
Lambda is deployed within a private subnet.

API Gateway only allows Lambda invocation securely.

Limitations:
This is a simulated setup using LocalStack endpoints; real AWS resources are not provisioned.
